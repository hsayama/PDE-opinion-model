# PDE-opinion-model

This repository contains codes for numerical simulation and visualization of a partial differential equation (PDE)-based opinion dynamics model studied in the following paper:
* Sayama, H. (2020) Enhanced ability of information gathering may intensify disagreement among groups. _Phys. Rev. E_ 102, 012303.

Contents are as follows:
* PDE-opinion-model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook of a Julia code for numerical simulation of the model
* visualization.nb: Mathematica notebook for visualization of the simulation results
* results_sigma=1.0_mu=1.0.csv: sample simulation result generated using the Julia code (and visualizable with the Mathematica code)
